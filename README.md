# Stock-Market-Prediction
In the past decades, there is an increasing interest in predicting markets among economists, policymakers, academics and market makers. The objective of the proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to predict the stock price. Financial analysts investing in stock market usually are not aware of the stock market behavior. 
In today’s world, all the information pertaining to stock market is available. Analyzing all this information individually or manually is tremendously difficult. As such, automation of the process is required. Understanding that analysis of numerical time series gives close results, intelligent investors use machine learning techniques in predicting the stock market behavior. This will allow financial analysts to foresee the behavior of the stock that they are interested in and thus act accordingly. 

## Structure
#### 1. Data Extraction

###### * Moving Average:-  Average is easily one of the most common things we use in our day-to-day lives. The predicted closing price for each day will be the average of a set of previously observed values.
###### * Volatility:-  Volatility is a measure of change over time. In stock markets, it quantifies a stock’s lack of stability or the tendency of its prices to move up and down. Usually, the higher the volatility, the riskier the stock.
